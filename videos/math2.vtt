In this video we're talking about how to find the multiples of a number.

00:03.060 --> 00:07.710
And we've been asked to find the first five multiples of each of the numbers we've been given the multiples

00:07.710 --> 00:12.000
of a number are just the numbers that can be divided evenly by the number we've been given.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.020
In other words what I want to do to find the multiples of a number are multiply the given number in

00:16.020 --> 00:24.360
this case one by one by two by three by four and by five because we've been asked to find the first

00:24.360 --> 00:25.380
five multiples.

00:25.410 --> 00:31.320
So I'm going to say one times one is equal to 1 one times two is equal to two one times three is equal

00:31.320 --> 00:35.570
to three one times four is equal to four and one times five is equal to five.

00:35.610 --> 00:40.980
Which tells me that one two three four and five these results I got here are multiples of the number

00:40.980 --> 00:41.410
one.

00:41.430 --> 00:47.010
And I know that that's true because I can divide all of these numbers evenly by 1 so when I say 1 divided

00:47.010 --> 00:52.290
by one I get one which is a whole number answer when I say two divided by one I get two which is a whole

00:52.290 --> 00:58.180
number answer three divided by 1 gives me 3 4 divided by 1 gives me 4 or 5 divided by 1 gives me 5.

00:58.230 --> 00:59.570
I get home number answers.

00:59.610 --> 01:05.190
So if I want to find the first five multiples of three I just want to say three times one three times

01:05.190 --> 01:11.200
two three times three three times four and three times five.

01:11.310 --> 01:18.200
And the results I get are 3 6 9 12 and 15.

01:18.210 --> 01:22.920
So 3 6 9 12 and 15 are the first five multiples of three.

01:22.950 --> 01:27.930
I know that 3 6 9 12 and 15 will all divide evenly by three.

01:27.930 --> 01:30.640
In fact I can say three divided by one is three.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.650
Six divided by two is three.

01:32.670 --> 01:38.300
Nine divided by three is three 12 divided by four is three and 15 divided by five is three.

01:38.340 --> 01:42.510
Or I could say three divided by three gives me one Six divided by three gives me two.

01:42.630 --> 01:44.280
Nine divided by three gives me three.

01:44.280 --> 01:48.150
12 divided by three gives me four and 15 divided by three gives me five.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.850
So we're just looking for the multiples of that number.

01:50.850 --> 01:51.570
Same thing here.

01:51.570 --> 02:00.180
I can just say 12 times one is 12 12 times two is 24 12 times three is 36 12 times for us 48 and 12

02:00.180 --> 02:01.890
times 5 is 60.

02:01.890 --> 02:04.200
So all of these are multiples of the number 12.

02:04.220 --> 02:06.170
And I could keep going on to infinity.

02:06.180 --> 02:13.770
I could say 12 times 100 is twelve hundred and twelve hundred is a multiple of 12 as long as I can take

02:13.770 --> 02:18.000
the multiple and divided by the original number and get a whole number answer.

02:18.030 --> 02:20.890
I know that this number is a multiple of this number.

02:20.940 --> 02:26.570
So finding the first five multiples of 20 we say 20 times one is 20 times two is forty times three is

02:26.570 --> 02:30.610
60 times for is 80 times five is 100.

02:30.660 --> 02:32.810
And these are all multiples of 20.
