00:00.230 --> 00:04.600
In this video we're going to be doing a couple more examples where we find that Prak primes of a number

00:04.770 --> 00:06.050
by factoring the number.

00:06.120 --> 00:10.780
So in this first example here we're going to factor AB into its product primes.

00:10.780 --> 00:12.630
Now let's first talk about prime numbers.

00:12.630 --> 00:17.340
Remember that a prime number is a number that's only divisible by 1 and itself.

00:17.340 --> 00:23.040
So for example 2 is a prime number because I can divide it by two and I can divide it by 1 so I can

00:23.040 --> 00:24.720
divide it by 1 and itself.

00:24.810 --> 00:29.150
But there's no other number other than 1 and 2 that will go into two evenly.

00:29.160 --> 00:33.000
Three is a prime number because I can divide it by 1 and I can divide it by three.

00:33.090 --> 00:36.360
But there's no other number that will go into three evenly.

00:36.480 --> 00:41.650
If I look at four here am for is not a prime number because of course I can divide it by itself for

00:41.910 --> 00:46.450
I can divide it by 1 but I can also divide it by 2 when I divide it by 2.

00:46.500 --> 00:47.320
I get two.

00:47.340 --> 00:53.430
So four is not a prime number but five is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 in itself.

00:53.430 --> 01:00.720
Six is not prime because it's divisible by 1 in itself but it's also divisible by 3 and 2 7 is prime.

01:00.810 --> 01:07.240
Eight is not prime 9 is not prime because it's visible by 1 and itself and by 3.

01:07.260 --> 01:08.340
So you get the idea.

01:08.400 --> 01:13.800
Those are prime numbers sort I want to do is factor this number completely until it's just the product

01:13.890 --> 01:15.960
of all of its prime factors.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.330
So here's what that looks like.

01:17.400 --> 01:21.180
We can start anywhere so we know that AB is eight times 10.

01:21.180 --> 01:23.760
We know that 80 is 20 times four.

01:23.790 --> 01:26.670
We can start with any product that we know.

01:26.790 --> 01:30.630
Let's just go ahead and start with eight times 10 and again it doesn't matter you always get the same

01:30.630 --> 01:33.300
answer but we'll just start with eight times 10.

01:33.330 --> 01:37.170
So 80 is the same thing as eight times 10.

01:37.170 --> 01:39.670
So we write the factor of eight and the factor of 10.

01:39.750 --> 01:43.720
What we want to do is keep factoring until we only have prime numbers left.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.420
So is 8 a prime number.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.990
It can be divided by four and by two in addition to 1 and itself.

01:48.990 --> 01:50.360
So we have to keep factoring.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.630
We know that eight is four times two.

01:52.650 --> 01:55.020
So we'll say 4 times 2.

01:55.170 --> 02:00.690
Now two is a prime number it's only divisible by 1 and itself but four is not 4 can also be divided

02:00.690 --> 02:01.090
by two.

02:01.090 --> 02:02.530
So we have to keep factoring here.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.740
We know that 4 is 2 times 2.

02:05.970 --> 02:11.220
And now we know 2 is a prime number so we have 2 2 and 2 we can't factor any further over here.

02:11.250 --> 02:18.340
So let's go look at the 10 10 can be factored into 5 times 2 and 5 and 2 are both prime numbers.

02:18.330 --> 02:21.210
They can only be divided by 1 and themselves.

02:21.210 --> 02:23.180
So we have all prime numbers now.

02:23.220 --> 02:30.720
So if we look at the end of each of these tree branches if you will only the bottom layer then we have

02:30.780 --> 02:33.000
all of these numbers here.

02:33.030 --> 02:34.950
These are the prime factors of 80.

02:34.950 --> 02:39.630
And if you multiply two times five times two times two times two you'll get 80.

02:39.630 --> 02:42.900
So we factored 80 into all of it's prime factors.

02:42.900 --> 02:45.300
And now we want to write this as a product of primes.

02:45.360 --> 02:50.550
You always want to list your factors in ascending order so you want your smallest factors first followed

02:50.550 --> 02:54.300
by your larger factors so we have factors of two and factors of five.

02:54.300 --> 02:58.550
So we want to write the factors of two first because two is smaller than five.

02:58.590 --> 03:01.470
So we have four factors of 2 1 2 3 and 4.

03:01.530 --> 03:08.410
So we can say two times two times two times two for factors of two and a factor of five.

03:08.430 --> 03:13.530
So we can write it this way or we can use exponent and we can say since we have four factors of two

03:13.530 --> 03:16.980
we can write this as two to the fourth times five.

03:17.010 --> 03:20.130
And this is the product of primes for the number 80.

03:20.130 --> 03:23.010
Let's look at another example here we have 147.

03:23.010 --> 03:27.410
Sometimes it's helpful to look for prime numbers that can be divided into 147.

03:27.540 --> 03:33.540
So if we start with the smallest prime number which is two we know two can't go into 147 because 147

03:33.540 --> 03:34.700
is an odd number.

03:34.860 --> 03:35.830
What about 3.

03:35.850 --> 03:39.380
Well if we divide 147 by three we get 49.

03:39.380 --> 03:44.970
So because three divides evenly into 147 we'll go ahead and say three and forty nine.

03:44.970 --> 03:49.790
Now three is a prime number but 49 isn't because 49 can be divided by seven.

03:49.800 --> 03:55.950
So we want to divide this into seven times seven we know 49 is the perfect square of seven and seven

03:55.950 --> 03:56.910
is also a prime number.

03:56.910 --> 04:01.630
So now we've actually reached the end of our factorization here.

04:01.740 --> 04:05.350
And we just have three factors three times seven times seven.

04:05.490 --> 04:06.970
We'll get you to 147.

04:06.990 --> 04:11.520
So we want to list this as three times seven times seven.

04:11.640 --> 04:17.070
Or because we have two factors of seven we can write it as three times seven squared.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.920
And this is the product of primes for 147.
