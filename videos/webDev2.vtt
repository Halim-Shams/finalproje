00:00.270 --> 00:04.640
In this video we're talking about how to find the greatest common factor of a few manone meals.

00:04.650 --> 00:08.700
And we've been given three examples in the first example we've been asked to find the greatest common

00:08.700 --> 00:14.720
factor of our three monomials five 10 and 20 and let's just go ahead and clarify a few terms here.

00:14.730 --> 00:20.010
Monomial Remember means just one number manone meaning one and no real meaning number.

00:20.010 --> 00:25.710
So monomial is one number so five is one number ten is one number 20 is one number.

00:25.710 --> 00:31.370
So these are three monomials and we've been asked to find the greatest common factor among these three

00:31.410 --> 00:32.370
monomials.

00:32.490 --> 00:37.500
The greatest common factor is going to be the largest number or the largest number of factors that divide

00:37.530 --> 00:39.990
evenly into all three of our monomials.

00:39.990 --> 00:45.510
So what we want to do to find the greatest common factor in its most basic level and way faster doing

00:45.510 --> 00:46.820
this as we get more practice.

00:46.830 --> 00:51.510
But what we want to do is break down each of our numbers into their prime factors then we'll take all

00:51.510 --> 00:56.160
of the factors that these numbers have in common and multiply them together to find the greatest common

00:56.160 --> 00:56.730
factor.

00:56.730 --> 01:02.400
So here's what that looks like five broken down into its prime factors is just going to be five.

01:02.400 --> 01:02.700
Right.

01:02.700 --> 01:04.470
Five is already a prime number.

01:04.470 --> 01:10.260
So the only factor of five is going to be five 10 and a broken down into its prime factors is going

01:10.260 --> 01:15.020
to be five and to 20 broken down into its prime factors.

01:15.030 --> 01:20.630
If we do first 10 and two and then from 10 we do five and two.

01:20.850 --> 01:28.380
Notice that we have five two and two with our monomials broken down into their prime factors at this

01:28.380 --> 01:28.770
point.

01:28.770 --> 01:33.080
We're looking for the factors that are common to all three of our monomials.

01:33.120 --> 01:39.830
So if we start at the top and we look at this first factor here a 5 right so look at Fibe here is five.

01:39.840 --> 01:45.800
In our other two monomial numbers yes it is we have a factor of five here and a factor of five here.

01:45.840 --> 01:51.210
So because this factor of five sort of matches across all three monomials it exists in the breakdown

01:51.210 --> 01:51.980
of all three.

01:52.020 --> 01:56.720
We can include it in our greatest common factor if we look at this next factor here of two.

01:56.760 --> 02:02.010
We can see that we have this factor of two involved in the breakdown for 10 and also a factor of two

02:02.010 --> 02:03.660
involved in the breakdown for 20.

02:03.720 --> 02:07.760
But we don't have a factor of two involved in the breakdown for five.

02:07.770 --> 02:13.200
So we can't include it in our greatest common factor nor can we include this sort of second two that's

02:13.200 --> 02:18.810
involved here in the 20 because again we still don't have a factor of 2 involved in our breakdown for

02:18.840 --> 02:23.240
five which means that the only thing we can include in our greatest common factor is five.

02:23.280 --> 02:29.910
So the greatest common factor for 5 10 and 20 is going to be five which means this is the largest value

02:29.940 --> 02:32.900
that can go evenly into 5 10 and 20.

02:32.910 --> 02:35.950
Let's go ahead and look at a slightly more complicated example here.

02:36.060 --> 02:41.160
We have the three monomial numbers six a six A-squared and 12 8 cubed.

02:41.160 --> 02:46.080
So we've got now a variable involved of a we need to break these monomials down first by looking at

02:46.080 --> 02:47.280
these constant coefficient.

02:47.280 --> 02:51.320
So first we'll look at 6 6 and 12 then we'll look at the variables for a.

02:51.360 --> 02:58.140
So if we breakdown 6 into its prime factors the factors are going to be three and 2 if we break down

02:58.140 --> 03:04.410
6 here into its prime factors we're going to get three and two if we break down 12 into its prime factors

03:04.710 --> 03:08.900
we'll get four and three and then break down 4 into two and two.

03:08.910 --> 03:12.760
So what we'll end up with is 3 2 and 2.

03:12.780 --> 03:14.930
Now we need to look at our variables here.

03:14.940 --> 03:18.530
We have just a single factor of a we can't break that down any further.

03:18.540 --> 03:20.300
So we have this factor of a.

03:20.370 --> 03:24.450
Here we have A-squared which we can break down into a and a.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.160
And here we have a cube or three factors of a.

03:27.160 --> 03:30.370
So we can break that down into a a and a.

03:30.450 --> 03:35.430
So now our monomials are completely factored into their prime factors and we need to go ahead and look

03:35.430 --> 03:36.880
for common factors.

03:36.900 --> 03:43.370
So if we start with this first factor in 6 8 we have three and we can see that we have 3 3 and 3.

03:43.380 --> 03:46.290
That factor is common to all three of our monomials.

03:46.380 --> 03:52.680
We can see also that too is a factor which is common to all three monomial so we can pull that out.

03:52.680 --> 03:58.260
We have this extra factor of 2 for the 12 but we don't have that extra factor of 2 involved in either

03:58.260 --> 04:01.330
of these first two meals so we're not going to be able to pull that out.

04:01.410 --> 04:08.030
So we're going to go ahead and skip to a we notice that we have a common factor of a in all three manone

04:08.040 --> 04:13.440
meals but we don't have a second common factor of a or a third common factor of a because even though

04:13.440 --> 04:18.570
there's an additional A involved in the six A-squared and the 12 cubed we don't have another factor

04:18.570 --> 04:20.810
of a to pull out of 6 a.

04:20.850 --> 04:26.530
So that means that all we can take is the three the two and the a.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.470
So we can pull those three things out.

04:28.470 --> 04:31.630
And then what we're going to do is multiply them together.

04:31.710 --> 04:35.790
And when we do that where you make it three times two is six times a six a.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.570
So we get six A.

04:37.680 --> 04:42.360
As our greatest common factor if we look at our last example here of the same thing that we did in the

04:42.360 --> 04:47.520
second example in other words we're going to look at these constant coefficients for two and 10 and

04:47.520 --> 04:50.850
break those down into their prime factors and then look at the variables.

04:50.850 --> 04:58.800
So for for you in turn will break down four into two and two will break down two into just two and we'll

04:58.800 --> 05:05.940
break down 10 into five and two then we need to look at our exes we have x squared x and x y.

05:05.950 --> 05:13.000
We can break down x squared into X and X but we can't break down X at all so we just have X here and

05:13.000 --> 05:18.400
we have X here and then for why we can't break that down it can't break it down at all here and for

05:18.400 --> 05:21.950
Y squared we can break down into why and why.

05:21.970 --> 05:25.750
So now we've got our prime factors and we need to look for common factors.

05:25.750 --> 05:31.570
Notice here that we can pull out a two from each of these we'll pull out the two we can't pull out of

05:31.570 --> 05:35.310
five because five is unique to this 10 X Y squared.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.730
Bob doesn't exist as a factor in either of these two men on wheels.

05:38.830 --> 05:44.110
We can't pull out this additional two but we can pull out an X from all three.

05:44.110 --> 05:49.300
So pull out an X from all three and we'll get that down there and we can pull out a y from all three.

05:49.300 --> 05:54.190
So there's a y a y and a Y and we'll pull that out there.

05:54.190 --> 05:58.660
We know that we can't possibly take out anything else because notice here this 2 x y.

05:58.660 --> 06:02.490
We've taken every factor from the to X Y there's no more factors we can take.

06:02.530 --> 06:07.410
So it would be literally impossible for us to pull any other factor into our greatest common factor

06:07.420 --> 06:14.110
so then we just multiply our results together and we say that 2 x y is the greatest common factor of

06:14.200 --> 06:18.650
4 x squared Y to X Y and 10 x y squared.

06:18.760 --> 06:23.560
Now I want to make sure that we be careful here with this video because in these three examples we took

06:23.560 --> 06:26.850
out a phi which happened to be our smallest number.

06:26.890 --> 06:32.560
We took out a six a a which in a way happened to be our smallest number here and we took out a 2 x y

06:32.770 --> 06:36.730
which happened to be sort of our smallest number but that won't always be the case.

06:36.730 --> 06:41.380
It won't always work out that the smallest factor that you have here is going to be your greatest common

06:41.380 --> 06:47.940
factor and we can illustrate that by changing this to X Y here to for example to X Y squared.

06:47.950 --> 06:52.960
If we had been given these three memorials instead where this was 2 X Y squared we only would have been

06:52.960 --> 06:57.460
able to pull out a single factor of Y because we would have been limited by the fact that we only have

06:57.460 --> 06:58.890
one factor of y here.

06:58.990 --> 07:01.190
But we had two of them here and two of them here.

07:01.210 --> 07:05.090
So our greatest common factor still would have been to X Y.

07:05.110 --> 07:10.640
But that wouldn't have been the same as sort of our smallest factor 2 x y squared here.

07:10.690 --> 07:14.950
So we have to be really careful whenever we're finding a greatest common factor to break each monomial

07:14.950 --> 07:20.770
down into its prime factors for the whole numbers or the constant coefficients and for each of our variables

07:20.860 --> 07:25.510
and then make sure that we're really deliberate when we're looking for common factors to build into

07:25.510 --> 07:27.070
our greatest common factor.
