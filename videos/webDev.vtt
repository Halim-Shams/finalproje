00:00.240 --> 00:04.740
In this video we're talking about prime factorization and how to use prime factorization to find the

00:04.740 --> 00:06.540
product of primes of a number.

00:06.540 --> 00:10.430
We're going to do for examples in the first one is the number 102.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.020
And we want to find the prime factors of 102.

00:13.020 --> 00:17.650
So remember that a prime number is a number which is only divisible by 1 and itself.

00:17.670 --> 00:21.150
So one is a special number but two is a prime number.

00:21.180 --> 00:27.450
The only factors of 2 are 1 and 2 3 is also a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and itself.

00:27.450 --> 00:33.720
So you can only divide three evenly by 1 and 3 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by

00:33.720 --> 00:35.470
1 in itself 1 and 4.

00:35.490 --> 00:38.060
But you can also divided by another number two.

00:38.070 --> 00:40.380
Which means that 4 is a composite number.

00:40.470 --> 00:42.010
So that's just a basic review.

00:42.020 --> 00:46.500
What we want to do here is find all of the prime numbers that have to be multiplied together in order

00:46.500 --> 00:47.660
to get 1 or 2.

00:47.670 --> 00:49.680
So when we're dealing with an even number right.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.770
102 is even it's an even number.

00:51.810 --> 00:56.760
When we're dealing with an even number the easiest way to start factoring is to divide by two because

00:56.760 --> 01:00.740
we know that all even numbers are divisible by 2 and 2 is a prime number.

01:00.750 --> 01:02.430
So we want to go ahead and divide by 2.

01:02.460 --> 01:08.100
And what we need to do is say what do we have to multiply by 2 in order to get 102 or in other words

01:08.370 --> 01:10.160
what's 102 divided by two.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.570
Well that's 51.

01:11.790 --> 01:15.240
So we get to and 51 as the factors of 102.

01:15.240 --> 01:18.750
Now we want to look at each of these numbers and see if we can factor them further.

01:18.750 --> 01:22.530
Well we know 2 is already a prime number so we can't factor it any further.

01:22.530 --> 01:23.940
But what about 51.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.470
Well 51 can be separated into factors of 3 and 17 because three times 17 is 51.

01:31.500 --> 01:37.500
Three is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and itself by 1 and 3 and 17 is a prime number

01:37.500 --> 01:43.320
because it's only divisible by 1 and itself 1 and 17 which means that we can't factor any further because

01:43.320 --> 01:47.690
once we've hit prime numbers at the end of all of these paths we know we can't go any farther.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.890
So we're done with our prime factorization.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.930
And then if we want to find the product of primes all we do is take all of our prime factors and multiply

01:54.930 --> 01:55.740
them together.

01:55.740 --> 02:02.100
So 2 3 and 17 are the prime factors that make up 102.

02:02.100 --> 02:07.220
So we just say two times three times 17 is the product of primes for 102.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.000
If we look at another example here we have 84.

02:10.020 --> 02:11.460
This is also an even number.

02:11.460 --> 02:14.190
So let's go ahead and divide it first by two.

02:14.310 --> 02:17.340
Times 42 gives us 84.

02:17.340 --> 02:25.530
So we'll divide 84 into 2 and 42 2 is a prime number but 42 isn't so we'll divide 42 into 2 and 21 2

02:25.590 --> 02:30.750
is a prime number but 21 isn't 21 can be divided into three and seven.

02:30.750 --> 02:37.410
So now what we can see is that at the end of each road here at the end of each path we got to a prime

02:37.410 --> 02:40.410
number two three and seven are all prime numbers.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.610
So we can't go any further.

02:41.610 --> 02:47.970
This is the prime factorization and the product of primes is going to be two times two times three times

02:47.970 --> 02:48.510
seven.

02:48.510 --> 02:52.940
Now when we have multiple factors of the same prime number here we have two factors of two.

02:52.980 --> 02:58.780
We can rewrite this as two squared or two factors of two times three times seven.

02:58.800 --> 03:04.410
And we always want to list our factors in ascending order so smallest factor first up to largest factor

03:04.410 --> 03:06.930
we had two and then three and then 17 here.

03:06.930 --> 03:10.890
Here we have two and then three and then seven and we want to write are factors of two together like

03:10.890 --> 03:11.400
this.

03:11.460 --> 03:14.010
Two factors of two is the same as two squared.

03:14.010 --> 03:16.300
Looking In another example here 24.

03:16.350 --> 03:19.460
We could divide by two if we wanted and get 2 and 12.

03:19.470 --> 03:24.660
But let's say instead that we maybe forget that we have two and 12 x factors and we want to divide instead

03:24.660 --> 03:28.770
into four and six because four times six is 24.

03:28.770 --> 03:36.200
Then we could say four is divided into two and two and six is divided into two times three.

03:36.210 --> 03:42.660
And now we can see that at the end of each path we have a prime number because to his prime and three

03:42.660 --> 03:43.530
is prime.

03:43.530 --> 03:47.970
So we know that we're down with our prime factorization and now we want to say that the product primes

03:48.090 --> 03:51.300
is two times two times two times three.

03:51.450 --> 03:58.320
Or we can rewrite it as two cubed times three which tells us three factors of two and one factor of

03:58.320 --> 03:58.860
three.

03:58.860 --> 04:03.420
Now the first three examples here we've had even numbers but sometimes we're going to have an odd number

04:03.510 --> 04:06.380
and with an odd number we just know that we're not going to be able to divide by two.

04:06.390 --> 04:08.180
But that doesn't mean that we can't factor it.

04:08.220 --> 04:15.750
So for example 15 here we can divide into factors of 3 and 5 because three times five gives us 15.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.470
Three is prime and five is prime.

04:18.480 --> 04:24.510
So we know that we're done and we can say that the product of primes is three times five for 15.

04:24.510 --> 04:29.610
In other words no matter what the number you're just looking to break down the number into irreducible

04:29.610 --> 04:30.480
prime factor.

04:30.480 --> 04:35.550
So at the end of each path you should have only prime numbers and then you take all those prime numbers

04:35.850 --> 04:38.580
and multiply them together to find the product of primes.
