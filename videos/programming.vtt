00:00.360 --> 00:04.440
In this video we're talking about how to find the least common multiple of a set of numbers and the

00:04.440 --> 00:08.760
least common multiple is just the smallest value that two numbers will go into.

00:08.760 --> 00:14.730
So to take a really easy example if we have two numbers two and three and we want to find the least

00:14.730 --> 00:20.360
common multiple We have to figure out what's the smallest number that 2 and 3 both divide into.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.660
So if we think about that per second we can probably come up with the fact the least common multiple

00:24.660 --> 00:31.200
of these two numbers is six because three goes into six two times and two goes into six three times.

00:31.200 --> 00:35.880
And there's no value smaller than 6 that 2 and 3 both divide into evenly.

00:35.880 --> 00:42.000
Now in this particular example two times three gives us six but you can't find the least common multiple

00:42.060 --> 00:44.770
Just by multiplying all of your values together.

00:44.850 --> 00:49.530
If you multiply all the values together you'll certainly get a multiple but you won't necessarily get

00:49.530 --> 00:50.910
the least common multiple.

00:50.910 --> 00:58.050
An example of this would be if I had the three numbers for 5 and 10 and I wanted to find the least common

00:58.050 --> 00:58.720
multiple.

00:58.770 --> 01:06.430
If I just multiply all three of them together four times five gives me 20 20 times 10 it gives me 200.

01:06.450 --> 01:12.120
And so if I say that the least common multiple is 200 I'm actually wrong because 20 is the least common

01:12.120 --> 01:12.710
multiple.

01:12.720 --> 01:19.880
And the reason is because four times five gives me 20 and 10 also happens to go into 20 evenly goes

01:19.880 --> 01:21.180
in 22 times.

01:21.180 --> 01:26.430
So 20 is the least common multiple of these three numbers not just the product of these three.

01:26.430 --> 01:31.960
So if I can't just multiply my numbers together how am I supposed to find that he's come multiple.

01:32.010 --> 01:36.380
Well the way that we do it is by reducing all of our numbers to their prime factors.

01:36.390 --> 01:40.560
And once we've reduced them to their prime factors then we can pull out the values that we'll have to

01:40.560 --> 01:44.550
multiply together to get the least common multiple of the original numbers.

01:44.550 --> 01:51.180
So for example in this set I have 30 75 and 80 and I want to find the least common multiple of these

01:51.180 --> 01:51.990
three numbers.

01:51.990 --> 01:57.720
So I want to reduce each of them to their prime factor so with 30 I can start with 30 is the product

01:57.810 --> 02:05.670
of three and 10 and 10 is the product of 2 and 5 2 3 and 5 here are all prime numbers.

02:05.670 --> 02:09.770
So I've reduced 30 to it's prime factors now for 75.

02:09.780 --> 02:13.730
I can say three times 25 for 25.

02:13.740 --> 02:18.660
I can say five times 5 3 5 5 are all prime numbers.

02:18.720 --> 02:25.510
So I know that overdue 75 to it's prime factors for 80 here will do eight times ten.

02:25.800 --> 02:33.720
Eight is going to be two and four and four is going to be two and two ten is going to be two and five.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.190
These are all prime numbers here.

02:35.340 --> 02:36.440
So I'm down to the bottom.

02:36.510 --> 02:40.530
Now I want to pull these together so here for 30 I have two three and five.

02:40.530 --> 02:45.930
So I have two of the first three to the first and five to the first power for seventy five.

02:45.930 --> 02:50.700
I have three to the first but I have five squared because I have two factors of five.

02:50.700 --> 02:53.880
So three times five squared.

02:53.880 --> 02:59.460
And then here for me I have two to the fourth because I have one two three four factors of two.

02:59.460 --> 03:02.790
So two to the fourth power times five.

03:02.790 --> 03:06.070
Now at this point I want to look for the greatest value of each of these factors.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.510
So I have factors of two three and five for two.

03:09.510 --> 03:12.780
I have two of the first power and I have two to the fourth power.

03:12.780 --> 03:17.990
I have to take the greatest value of the factor of two so I have to take two to the fourth.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.160
So two to the fourth there.

03:20.160 --> 03:24.480
Now I want to look my factors of three of three to the first power here and three to the first power

03:24.480 --> 03:26.630
here so I take three to the first.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.020
So three for five.

03:28.020 --> 03:30.930
I have five five squared and five.

03:30.930 --> 03:33.950
I have to take five square because that's my greatest value.

03:34.110 --> 03:35.670
So five squared.

03:35.670 --> 03:41.630
Now at this point the product of these three is going to be my least common multiple of 30 75 and 80.

03:41.670 --> 03:46.740
So I just need to multiply out here to get my final answer to to the fourth is going to be 16.

03:46.740 --> 03:51.750
Because remember it's two times two times two times two which I know is 16.

03:51.750 --> 03:56.970
Multiply that by three and then five squared we know is twenty five.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.370
Sixteen times three gives me forty eight.

03:59.370 --> 04:03.690
So I get 48 times 25 when I multiply 48 by 25.

04:03.690 --> 04:05.640
I get twelve hundred.

04:05.700 --> 04:10.200
So 1200 is my least common multiple of 30.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.230
75 and 80 30 75 and 80.

04:13.350 --> 04:18.780
All divide evenly into twelve hundred and twelve hundred is the smallest value for which that's the

04:18.780 --> 04:22.270
case for which 30 75 and 80 all go in evenly.

04:22.410 --> 04:28.330
So now let's look at another example where we have 15 A-squared B and 10 a B cubed.

04:28.380 --> 04:34.500
When we have variables like this they're already reduced as far as they can be so A-squared B and AB

04:34.500 --> 04:36.870
cubed are all going to remain just as they are.

04:36.900 --> 04:40.330
But we need to reduce the 15 and then 10 into their prime factors.

04:40.470 --> 04:47.730
So 15 is going to give us three and five both prime and 10 is going to give us two and five both prime.

04:47.730 --> 04:54.890
So now here for 15 A-squared B we have three times five times a squared times.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.420
B These are our prime factors essentially.

04:57.420 --> 05:05.450
And then for ten a B cubed we have 2 times five times a times b cubed and I remember now we want to

05:05.450 --> 05:09.970
take the largest value of each of our factors so we have here this to the first.

05:09.970 --> 05:10.970
There's no other 2.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.600
So we have to take that too.

05:12.740 --> 05:16.680
This is the only three here it's three of the first powers so we have to take the three.

05:16.790 --> 05:19.350
We have five of the first and five to the first in both.

05:19.370 --> 05:24.860
So we have to take five to the first and then we have A-squared an A because A-squared is greater we

05:24.860 --> 05:26.880
have to take A-squared instead of a.

05:26.890 --> 05:28.660
So a squared.

05:28.730 --> 05:33.950
And we have B and B cube so because B cubed is greater we have to take the B cubed instead of just the

05:33.950 --> 05:34.320
B.

05:34.400 --> 05:40.060
So then multiplying all of these together two times three gives us six six times five gives us 30.

05:40.100 --> 05:44.870
So we have 30 and then just a squared B cubed.

05:44.930 --> 05:52.120
So 30 A-squared be cute is the least common multiple of our two original values 15 a squared B and 10

05:52.130 --> 05:53.430
a B cubed.

05:53.480 --> 05:58.160
Both of these values will divide evenly into 30 A-squared be cubed.
