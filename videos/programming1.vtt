00:00.220 --> 00:04.290
In this video we're talking about how to find the least common multiple of a set of numbers and the

00:04.290 --> 00:09.020
least common multiple is just the number that both of the numbers we've been given will divide into

00:09.030 --> 00:09.670
evenly.

00:09.720 --> 00:13.980
So in other words if we just talk about multiples in general here we've been given two numbers 10 and

00:13.980 --> 00:14.640
15.

00:14.850 --> 00:16.710
Let's talk about the multiples of 10.

00:16.740 --> 00:22.380
Well when we talk about the multiples of a number what we mean is the multiples of 10 will be 10 times

00:22.380 --> 00:22.950
1.

00:23.070 --> 00:32.010
So 10 10 times to 20 10 times three 30 10 times four is 40.

00:32.010 --> 00:39.330
So in other words 10 20 30 and 40 are all multiples of 10 and I could keep going on to infinity 50 60

00:39.330 --> 00:42.630
70 80 90 100 110 120.

00:42.630 --> 00:47.600
Those are all multiples of 10 because 10 divides evenly into all of those numbers.

00:47.610 --> 00:55.170
I could also look at the multiples of 15 I could say 15 times one gives me 15 15 times two gives me

00:55.170 --> 01:04.560
30 15 times three gives me 45 15 times four gives me 60 and I could keep going same thing.

01:04.560 --> 01:09.150
So 15 30 45 and 60 are all multiples of 15.

01:09.180 --> 01:13.860
So then when I say I want to find the least common multiple of two numbers for example I want to find

01:13.860 --> 01:19.200
the least common multiple of 10 and 15 I'm looking for the smallest number that matches between these

01:19.200 --> 01:20.030
two sets.

01:20.130 --> 01:28.350
And what I can see is that that's going to be 30 30 is the smallest number that 10 and 15 divide into

01:28.350 --> 01:35.040
evenly because 30 is a multiple of both 10 and 15 and there's no number that's smaller than 30 the 10

01:35.040 --> 01:42.750
and 15 both go into evenly 10 goes into 10 and 20 evenly but 15 doesn't 15 goes into 15 evenly but 10

01:42.750 --> 01:44.580
doesn't go into 15 evenly.

01:44.670 --> 01:46.830
So 30 is the least common multiple.

01:46.860 --> 01:53.990
If I kept going here with 10 I could say ten times five is 50 and ten times six is 60.

01:54.060 --> 02:00.960
And then I could say that 60 is also a multiple of 10 and 15 because it's in both sets.

02:01.020 --> 02:05.230
But it's not the least common multiple because 30 is smaller than 60.

02:05.340 --> 02:09.750
So 30 is going to be my least common multiple of 10 and 15.

02:09.750 --> 02:13.560
Now what happens when you have a set of numbers that includes more than just two numbers and maybe it's

02:13.560 --> 02:18.030
going to be really difficult to write out all of the multiples of each number until you find one that

02:18.030 --> 02:20.180
matches across all three sets.

02:20.190 --> 02:24.440
Here we need to find the least common multiple of 24 10 and 15.

02:24.480 --> 02:25.840
So how do we do that.

02:25.860 --> 02:30.090
Well the easiest way to do it is to factor all three numbers into their prime factors.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.540
In other words we're going to do some prime factorization here.

02:32.580 --> 02:37.830
Remember with prime factorization if we have an even number we know we can divide 2 into that number

02:37.830 --> 02:41.640
so we'll get 2 and 12 because two times 12 is 24.

02:41.640 --> 02:46.170
Remember also that a prime number is a number that's divisible only by 1 and itself.

02:46.200 --> 02:50.250
So two is a prime number because the only factors of 2 are 1 and 2.

02:50.250 --> 02:56.210
In other words 1 and the number itself 12 is not a prime number because I can divide it by 1 and 12

02:56.210 --> 02:56.960
1 in itself.

02:56.970 --> 03:00.310
But I can also divide it by 3 and 4 and 6.

03:00.330 --> 03:06.480
So I want to divide this again by two to get 2 and 6 and 2 is a prime number but 6 isn't so I need to

03:06.480 --> 03:09.550
divide 6 by 2 again and I get two and three.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.700
So two to two and three.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.560
Those are all prime numbers here.

03:13.800 --> 03:17.100
So I know that I'm done with my prime factorization.

03:17.220 --> 03:23.120
And now I just need to go ahead and write these out two times two times two times three.

03:23.130 --> 03:25.430
And this is the product of primes of 24.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.810
I need to do the same thing for 10 and 15.

03:27.840 --> 03:33.450
So I can divide 10 into two and five two and five are both prime numbers.

03:33.570 --> 03:39.570
So I can't go any further with my prime factorization and my product primes then is two times five for

03:39.570 --> 03:40.260
15.

03:40.260 --> 03:45.060
Divide that into three and five because three times five is 15.

03:45.060 --> 03:47.430
Three and five are both prime numbers.

03:47.430 --> 03:49.630
So I know I'm down with my prime factorization.

03:49.740 --> 03:52.290
I'm a product of primes is three and five.

03:52.290 --> 03:57.090
Now the only number for which I have a repeating factors and my product of primes is this 24 here I

03:57.090 --> 03:58.290
have three factors of two.

03:58.290 --> 04:02.400
So I want to rewrite this as two cubed times three.

04:02.400 --> 04:07.650
So here I have three factors of two and one factor of three here I have one factor of two and one factor

04:07.650 --> 04:08.270
of five.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.310
And here I have one factor of three and one factor of five.

04:11.310 --> 04:16.200
So when I want to find the least common multiple Now that I have my prime factors what I need to do

04:16.530 --> 04:18.760
is take the largest number of each factor.

04:18.760 --> 04:23.830
So what I see first of all is that I have factors of two and I have factors of two.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.410
I have factors of three and factors of three.

04:27.810 --> 04:31.420
And I have factors of five and factors of five.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.910
So I have to look at two.

04:32.970 --> 04:35.400
I have to look at three and I have to look at five.

04:35.430 --> 04:40.140
So first looking at two what's the largest number of factors that I have for two on this number I have

04:40.140 --> 04:42.120
three factors of two in this number.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.760
I have one factor of two.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.880
I have to take the larger number of factors of two.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.250
So I have to take three factors of two.

04:49.260 --> 04:51.000
So I'll say two cubed.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.630
Now I look at my factors of three.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.710
I have one factor of three and I have one factor of three.

04:55.710 --> 05:00.340
Those are equal so I just have to take one factor of three and then I have to look my factors of five

05:00.460 --> 05:03.070
I have one factor of five and one factor of five.

05:03.070 --> 05:08.830
So I have to take one factor of five and now I can just multiply all of these together to get my least

05:08.830 --> 05:09.730
common multiple.

05:09.730 --> 05:14.550
So I'm going to say two cubed or two times two times two that's going to give me eight.

05:14.650 --> 05:16.870
Three times five is going to give me 15.

05:16.870 --> 05:22.160
So I'm going to say eight times 15 eight times 15 is going to get me one hundred twenty.

05:22.210 --> 05:30.220
So 120 is going to be the least common multiple of 24 10 and 15 and I can prove to myself that 120 is

05:30.220 --> 05:35.320
a multiple of 24 10 and 15 by dividing 120 by all three of these numbers.

05:35.320 --> 05:41.740
So if I divide 120 by 24 I get five if I divide 120 by 10.

05:41.860 --> 05:45.600
I get 12 if I divide 120 by 15.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.610
I get eight.

05:46.750 --> 05:51.430
So I know that 24 10 and 15 all go evenly into 120.

05:51.430 --> 05:56.560
That helps me double check at least that I do have a multiple of three numbers I started with but this

05:56.560 --> 06:01.320
is the method you want to use to find the least common multiple set of numbers like this one.
