This video we're talking about Prime and composite numbers and we're trying to figure out which of the

00:04.350 --> 00:08.070
numbers we've been given are prime numbers and which ones are composite numbers.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.500
Numbers are either prime or composite.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.460
They can't be both.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.020
So what is a prime number.

00:13.020 --> 00:14.310
What is a composite number.

00:14.340 --> 00:19.590
Well prime number is a number which is evenly divisible by only one and itself.

00:19.590 --> 00:25.440
In other words there is no number besides one and the number itself that will go evenly into the number

00:25.440 --> 00:26.250
we've been given.

00:26.250 --> 00:31.440
So if we look at this first example three we know that one will go into three because three divided

00:31.440 --> 00:32.460
by one is three.

00:32.460 --> 00:34.740
That goes and evenly we get a whole number answer.

00:34.740 --> 00:40.230
We also know that three is a factor of three because three goes into three evenly one time we had a

00:40.230 --> 00:40.650
whole number.

00:40.650 --> 00:43.160
Answer When we say three divided by three we get one.

00:43.170 --> 00:46.770
So we know that one goes into three and we know that three goes into three.

00:46.770 --> 00:49.840
But there are no other numbers that go evenly into three.

00:49.860 --> 00:54.540
If we try to divide three by any number that's larger than three we're going to get a decimal answer.

00:54.540 --> 00:59.140
And if we try to divide 3 by a number between its factors for example try to divide three by two.

00:59.250 --> 01:03.420
We're going to get a decimal answer When we're talking about prime numbers and composite numbers.

01:03.450 --> 01:05.970
We don't consider numbers that are zero or negative.

01:06.090 --> 01:08.700
We're only talking about positive whole numbers.

01:08.700 --> 01:14.580
So the only factors of 3 are 1 and 3 which means that 3 is a prime number.

01:14.580 --> 01:15.560
What about 5.

01:15.600 --> 01:19.900
Well we know one goes into five evenly one will always go into every number evenly.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.050
So that's a given.

01:21.060 --> 01:23.550
We know that 5 will go into five evenly right.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.020
The number itself is always going to go in evenly.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.690
But what about any other numbers.

01:27.690 --> 01:31.950
Well the only numbers we have to consider are numbers greater than 5 and those are of course always

01:31.950 --> 01:36.860
going to give us a decimal answer and trying to divide 5 by any number between its factors here two

01:36.860 --> 01:39.420
three and four will give us a decimal answer.

01:39.450 --> 01:45.030
So there are no positive whole numbers that will go evenly into five other than 1 in 5 which means that

01:45.030 --> 01:47.540
5 is also a prime number.

01:47.550 --> 01:48.490
What about 35.

01:48.510 --> 01:53.280
Well we know that one is going to go on evenly and we know that 35 is going to go and evenly that's

01:53.280 --> 01:54.390
always going to be the case.

01:54.420 --> 01:56.110
The number one and the number itself.

01:56.130 --> 01:59.030
But what about any values between 1 and 35.

01:59.070 --> 02:02.430
Well we know that 5 goes into 35 evenly.

02:02.430 --> 02:07.630
In fact it goes in seven times which means that both 5 and 7 go into 35 evenly.

02:07.650 --> 02:14.880
So because there are factors of 35 other than 1 and 35 other than 1 and the number itself we call this

02:14.940 --> 02:21.210
a composite number which means that the number has factors other than one in itself that divide evenly

02:21.210 --> 02:22.000
into the number.
